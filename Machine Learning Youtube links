More the data > Better will be the Model > will get Higher Accuracy Predications.

Scenario 1: Supervised Learning
Scenario 2: Reinforcement Learning
Scenario 3: Unsupervised Learning﻿

Scenario 1: Facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs
Explanation: It is supervised learning. Here Facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person. 
Therefore, the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labelled data, it is supervised learning.

Scenario 2: Recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices
Explanation: It is supervised learning. The model is training a classifier on pre-existing labels (genres of songs).
This is what Netflix, Pandora, and Spotify do all the time, they collect the songs/movies that you like already, 
evaluate the features based on your likes/dislikes and then recommend new movies/songs based on similar features.

Scenario 3: Analyze bank data for suspicious looking transactions and flag the fraud transactions
Explanation: It is unsupervised learning. In this case, the suspicious transactions are not defined, 
hence there are no labels of "fraud" and "not fraud". The model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as 'fraud'.﻿


Supervised Learning:
Feature 
Lable

Lables data to predict the output

UnSupervised Learning:

dataset with Names , scores and wockets taken

Cluster ( Bowlers and batsmen )

No lables of bowler , batsmen.

-------------------------

Reinforcement learning:

Input > Model > Output > Feedback to Model and learn .

 Calculus
machine learning is really statistics

What's the difference between probability and statistics?
I've always thought that probability is a subclass of statistics.﻿

statistics is about what already happened (past and present), 
and making insights from that.. 
probability is about making predictions (future)﻿

statistics : Is the core of every thing
Calculus (Tells us How to learn and optimise our Model )
Linear Algebra (Makes running these algorithems fesibliible in the massive data set)
Probability:Helps predict the likly hose of the even happens
